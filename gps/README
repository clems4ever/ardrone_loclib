gpsUsb is a simple tool for configuring the PmodGPS board (and maybe other GPS board)

It uses a set of predefined commands to configure the gps chip.
Possible options are:
-F <device> the device file (default is /dev/ttyUSB0)
-b	    set baudrate (9600 38400 115200) default is 9600 baud
-B N    change GPS chip baudrate and exit N=[9600 | 38400 | 115200]
-r      read communication and print to stdout
        cannot be used in combination with -B (an error message will be
        displayed, but the program just ignore -r option)
-h	    print this help message
-t	    test the GPS sending a null message, then read
-S	    put GPS in simple mode : only send GGA and RMC strings equivalent
        to -o simple
-u N	  set update rate of gps fix [1 5 10] Hz
        Note that to enable 5Hz or 10Hz update rate, you first need to
        select a baudrate of 38400 as minimum.
-o <mode> change output options of NMEA sentences. Possible options
	      are default, gga, rmc, rmc+gga, simple (equivalent to rmc+gga)

Acknowledgements:

GPS board sends PMTK_ACK packets when it receives a PMTK request
These ACK sentences are like this:
     $PMTK001,Cmd,Flag*checksum
Where Cmd is the PMTK request flag (e.g 251 for a baudrate change) and flag
is:
     0 = invalid command
     1 = unsupported command
     2 = valid command, but action failed
     3 = valid commad, action succeeded
